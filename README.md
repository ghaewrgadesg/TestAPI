# A Test API Created Using Spring Boot

This project utilizes Spring Boot to create a simple API that interacts with a MySQL database. The database schema is included in a `.sql` format file.

## Database Overview

The database is a modified version of one I created for a project management system. It consists of three entities:

- **User**
- **Task**
- **Project**

Tasks are included in a project, and these tasks can be assigned to members within the project.

## API Features

The API has basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functions implemented for the entities.
